Project 3 - Description:
Given a set of vertices, and a set of edges in an adjacency matrix, determine the existing cycle in a
directed graph.

Assume there is always one and only one cycle.

Example:

Input -> Vertices (as an array of strings within the program)

vertices = { 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'}

Adjacency matrix (as a bi-dimensional array within the program)

-999 is a value that represents infinity.

matrix=
{
-999  18   14  -999 16
-999 -999 -999  10  -999
-999  13  -999 -999 -999
-999 -999 -999 -999  11
-999 -999  17  -999 -999
}

Output:

Cycle vertices (as an array of strings within the program)
vertices = { ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’}

Also, notice the vertex list is not a set (where member order is not relevant) but a sequence (where
order matters).
